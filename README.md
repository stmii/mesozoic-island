A database to track employees, exhibits, dinosaurs, and shifts for a dinosaur theme park

CITATIONS: Much of the Node/Handlebars was based on the example app from the course.
The code for handling the reading of multiple Exhibits in public/js/add_shift.js and public/js/update_shift.js was based on example 1. Using for...of statement from https://www.techiedelight.com/get-selected-values-multi-select-dropdown-javascript/, but all of the code surrounding looping through those arrays in app.js for /put-shift-ajax/ and /post-shift-ajax/ was original.  The CSS was original and the DDL was handwritten.
